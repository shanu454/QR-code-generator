# QR-code-generator
Creating a QR code generator in Python is a practical and interesting project that combines simplicity with a real-world application. This project involves using the qrcode library in Python to generate QR codes, which are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data, such as URLs, text, or other information. QR codes are widely used in different industries for various purposes, such as marketing, authentication, and data sharing.

QR Code Generator Project Overview
Introduction
A QR code (Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) invented in 1994 by the Japanese company Denso Wave. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. QR codes use four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to efficiently store data.

Features of the QR Code Generator
User Input: The generator takes user input to create a QR code. The input can be a URL, text, or any other type of data.
